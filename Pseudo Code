Motor1 = x-axis
Motor2 = y-axis
Motor3 = rotational z-axis

This program measures the most power at varied angles that the 
solar panel absorbs and positions the mechanism to those optimum points.

Loop Setup

for element to 360 degrees

}

{
In the main function loop

turn on Motor1 CW until panel is 60 degrees
{
	while Motor3 angle is less than 360 degrees
	
		rotate Motor3 1 degree
			measure and store voltage data in array
}

check max voltage in array 
check correlating element with max volatage

rotate motor3 to degree of max voltage element

{
	while Motor1 is less than 60 degrees
		
		rotate Motor1 1 degree
			measure and store voltage data in array
}

check max voltage in array
check correlating element with max voltage

rotate Motor1 to degree of max voltage element

delay (30 min)
